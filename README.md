# Gwent: The Witcher Card Game

This project is a tribute to the captivating card game featured in "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", a masterpiece developed by CD Projekt in 2015. Leveraging [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for a robust and efficient development process, the project intricately mimics the game's mechanics and aesthetics. It integrates a dedicated API, "API-Gwent", specifically designed to incorporate the beloved first version of Gwent's cards that fans adored in the original game.

## Description

The opening screen introduces players to the deck preparation phase, offering a choice among four distinct main decks: the Nilfgaardian Empire, Northern Realms, Scoia'tael, and Monsters. Players can further customize their decks with an array of additional cards classified into Heroes, Weather, and Special categories, each providing unique enhancements and strategic advantages. The game's core objective is to meticulously craft a personal deck, tailored to your strategic preferences, which will be pivotal in the forthcoming phase (*note: this phase is currently in the development stage*).
